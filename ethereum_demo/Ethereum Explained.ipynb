    "### Let's talk Merkle Trees for a second\n",
    "\n",
    "- Merkle trees are a fundamental part of what makes blockchains tick. \n",
    "- Theoretically possible to make a blockchain without Merkle trees by creating giant block headers that directly contain every transaction\n",
    "- But Doing that poses large scalability challenges\n",
    "- Merkle trees make it possible to build Ethereum nodes that run on all sorts of computers\n",
    "- A way of hashing a large number of “chunks” of data together which relies on splitting the chunks into buckets, where each bucket contains only a few chunks, then taking the hash of each bucket and repeating the same process, continuing to do so until the total number of hashes remaining becomes only one: the root hash\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://blog.ethereum.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/merkle.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allows for Merkle Proofs\n",
    "- A Merkle proof consists of a chunk, the root hash of the tree, and the “branch” consisting of all of the hashes going up along the path from the chunk to the root\n",
    "- Someone reading the proof can verify that the hashing is consistent going all the way up the tree \n",
    "- Allows a mechanism for authenticating a small amount of data, like a hash, to be extended to also authenticate large databases of potentially unbounded size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bitcoin blockchain uses Merkle proofs in order to store the transactions in every block:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://blog.ethereum.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/mining.jpg \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit that this provides is the concept that Satoshi described as “simplified payment verification”: instead of downloading every transaction and every block, a “light client” can only download the chain of block headers, 80-byte chunks of data for each block that contain only five things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A hash of the previous header\n",
    "- A timestamp\n",
    "- A mining difficulty value\n",
    "- A proof of work nonce\n",
    "- A root hash for the Merkle tree containing the transactions for that block.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's limitation is that whileit can prove the inclusion of transactions, they cannot prove anything about the current state (eg. digital asset holdings, name registrations, the status of financial contracts, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "So Every block header in Ethereum contains not just one Merkle tree, but three trees for three kinds of objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transactions\n",
    "- Receipts (essentially, pieces of data showing the effect of each transaction)\n",
    "- State\n",

    "- The Ethereum Virtual Machine is ‘calculate’ element that runs contract logic\n",
    "- Swarm is Peer-to-Peer file sharing, similar to BitTorrent, but incentivised with micropayments of ETH. \n",
    "- Whisper is an encrypted messaging protocol that allows nodes to send messages directly to each other in a secure way and that also hides the sender and receiver from third party snoopers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run Ethereum, you can download (or write yourself if you have the patience) some software called an Ethereum client. Just like BitTorrent or Bitcoin, the Ethereum client will connect over the internet to other people’s computers running similar client software and start downloading the Ethereum blockchain from them to catch up. It will also independently validate that each block conforms to the Ethereum rules.\n",

    "- Connect to the Ethereum network\n",
    "- Explore Ethereum’s blockchain\n",
    "- Create new transactions and smart contracts\n",
    "- Run smart contracts\n",
    "- Mine for new blocks\n",
    "- Your computer becomes a ‘node’ on the network, running an Ethereum Virtual Machine, and behaves equivalently to all the other nodes. Remember in a peer-to-peer network there is no ‘master’ server and any computer has equivalent powers or status to any other.\n",
